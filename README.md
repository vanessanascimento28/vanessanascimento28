# ❤️Welcome! It's so great to have you here.

💻I'm Vanessa, 29 years old and currently transitioning careers. I have a background in Business Administration, but recently I discovered a true passion for technology. 

😊I just completed a Front-End Development bootcamp at TripleTen, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and built several real-world projects.

- Now, I’m all in on Front-End! My amazing wife is a UX Designer 🎨💡, and together we’re building our own company focused on crafting beautiful, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces for apps 📱✨

- I’m always curious, always learning — and super excited to connect and collaborate on awesome projects! 🤝💬
